# DropOfLife
This project was apart of my thesis project during my time at NYU's ITP Master's Program.
My goal is to try to understand how the foods I eat affect my blood sugar by developing a simple iOS mobile application that tracks blood glucose responses to the food I eat and visualizes them for quick and easy interpretation.
